## About my tasks

The tasks were really awesome and by doing these tasks I did get a glance of how the problems can be approached. These tasks indicate the quality of people who are the members of the club who had put their effort to make these tasks for us. I am sure that the current members of amFOSS are Equipped with the most updated knowledge in the field of Computer Science. I hope I can be a part of the community.

## Who's me?

I am Jithin John from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. I am a person who is interested in working with computers and to know about the newly introduced technologies in the field of Computer Science. I joined Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham after knowing about the lab facilities and clubs they provide for students for the best studies and Activities. I was firm on the desicion that I would only take up a branch which has Computer Science in it. I see amFOSS as the best platform with the best tech lovers who are ready to work and help others...
