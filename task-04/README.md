# Debugging Derbies
* This was an easy task, there were some typecasting issues, syntax errors, and some Display errors.
* I personally didn't face any problems in solving those errors.
* Thankyou to @yashk2000 and @ashwinkey04 for the support of some queries regarding round-off and import of libraries.
